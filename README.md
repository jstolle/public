# About /public

This is a fork of
[Buster Benson's /public](https://github.com/busterbenson/public).  I have
modified it for my own purposes, removng what is not relevant to me in
particular and adding what is.

My public self. AKA my attempt to discover how
I view the world and express it as concisely and honestly as
possible. [Let me know](mailto:busterbenson@gmail.com?subject=/public) if you
fork this and maintain own public self repository.
