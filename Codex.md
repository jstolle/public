1. **Cultivate quality time:** With myself, with other people, and with my interests.
2. **Look at what's uneasy:** Don't avoid the unresolved, unwanted, conflicted things that would benefit from attention. 
3. **Contemplate my mortality:** Remember that every minute here is a gift; embrace it and don't wast the time you have.
4. Review/update this list

## Lexicon
This is an list of ideas that have gotten hopelessly stuck in my brain. 

### Separation of Life Philosophy and Religion
I do not recall exactly how I came to learn about
[Stoicism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq), but I ordered and read
[A Guide to the Good Life](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0195374614/) in
late May 2013, and I believe that the separation of life philosophy and
religion is a healthy thing.  This is based, in equal parts on the fact that I
have not found a religion that does not give me pause, and from what I have
seen of religion-based life philosophies, the basis of those philosophies is a
supernatural driving force (be it a horrible afterlife or a lesson taught
through fantastical allegory) which does not pertain to modern life.

What I have found in Stoicism is that there are universal truths that can be
easily applied to my current life.  I am also teetering on the precipice of
declaring my search for faith at an end after approximately thirty-four years,
so leaning on a religion-based life philosophy does not make sense for me.


## Beliefs

### On the purpose of life

1. There are universal truths that everybody should learn during the course of
their lives; not everybody gets to all of them.
2. Nobody is fated to earn/get/win anything, but viewing a goal as something
to which one is fated is a terrific driver.

### On personal conduct

1. I must be patient with those who do not see answers as quickly as I do.
2. I must be patient with myself when I do not see answers as quickly a I
would like.
3. I must know when to put myself first.
4. I must love without boundaries, no matter the consequence.
5. I must forgive the unintentional tresspasses of others.
6. I must potect and help those in need when possible.

### On Spirituality

1. Gods are a better way to explain what we don't understand than a general
term like "magic," but they are too whimsical to base life on.
2. While I do not need a religion to help define myself, there is of
tremendous value in it for some people.

### On Science & The Universe

1. There is more that I don't know than I do know.

### On Health

1. Every body is different.
2. A high-fat, low carbohydrate diet works for me.
3. Our bodies do not understand man-made foods.
