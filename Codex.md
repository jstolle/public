## Review Every Day
Things I’d like to have primed in my brain every morning. This is stuff
currently churning in the front of my brain, which probably has high turnover
but which also has a good chance of getting somewhere new.

1. **Work Hard:** Put in 100%.  Always.
2. **Step Up:** Take personal responsibility; realize you're a critical part
of the solution; accept the consequences of your actions.
3. **Don't Waste:** "Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without;"
"stuff" is not the answer, nor the key to a happy life.
4. **Love Well:** Love your neighbor as well as you love yourself; your word
is your bond.
5. **Think Bigger:** Believe in something bigger than yourself -- faith,
freedom, and opportunity; be willing to fight for it, to die for it; what can
you do for the cause; be willing to embrace hardship for the sake of a greater cause.
6. **Look at what's uneasy:** Don't avoid the unresolved, unwanted, conflicted
things that would benefit from attention.
7. **Contemplate my mortality:** Remember that every minute here is a gift;
embrace it and don't waste the time you have.
8. **Do something foolish, something creative, and something generous:** Do
this every day, per Benjamin Graham.

## Lexicon
This is an list of ideas that have gotten hopelessly stuck in my brain. 

### Separation of Life Philosophy and Religion
I do not recall exactly how I came to learn about
[Stoicism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq), but I ordered and read
[A Guide to the Good Life](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0195374614/) in
late May 2013, and I believe that the separation of life philosophy and
religion is a healthy thing.  This is based, in equal parts on the fact that I
have not found a religion that does not give me pause, and from what I have
seen of religion-based life philosophies, the basis of those philosophies is a
supernatural driving force (be it a horrible afterlife or a lesson taught
through fantastical allegory) which does not pertain to modern life.

What I have found in Stoicism is that there are universal truths that can be
easily applied to my current life.  I am also teetering on the precipice of
declaring my search for faith at an end after approximately thirty-four years,
so leaning on a religion-based life philosophy does not make sense for me.


## Beliefs

### On the purpose of life

1. There are universal truths that everybody should learn during the course of
their lives; not everybody gets to all of them.
2. Nobody is fated to earn/get/win anything, but viewing a goal as something
to which one is fated is a terrific driver.

### On personal conduct

1. I must be patient with those who do not see answers as quickly as I do.
2. I must be patient with myself when I do not see answers as quickly a I
would like.
3. I must know when to put myself first.
4. I must love without boundaries, no matter the consequence.
5. I must forgive the unintentional tresspasses of others.
6. I must potect and help those in need when possible.

### On Spirituality

1. Gods are a better way to explain what we don't understand than a general
term like "magic," but they are too whimsical to base life on.
2. While I do not need a religion to help define myself, there is of
tremendous value in it for some people.

### On Science & The Universe

1. There is more that I don't know than I do know.

### On Health

1. Every body is different.
2. A high-fat, low carbohydrate diet works for me.
3. Our bodies do not understand man-made foods.

# Monthly Reports

### 2015: ++----+----

##### January 1st 2015:

*Summary:* Spent six weeks in Surrey, British Columbia for work.  It was a
good trip, but it killed my hip and wrecked my diet.  I am still recovering
from the dietary wreckage, and I haven't been helping myself on that front in
the face of Christmas (and all of it bread-laden goodness/evil).  I read
Mastermind: How To Think Like Sherlock Holmes, which was a wonderful book. 

*Old goal status:* Complete miss.  I did not make the time to finish the
podcast downloader, which is a complete failure on my part.

*Weight:* 226

*New goal:* Complete the podcast downloader and begin and finish the media
asset tracker.  Also, write a review of Mastermind.

### 2014: ++----+----

##### December 1st 2014:

*Summary:* Kayla was in Weatherford for one of her externships and was able to
 spend some time over a few weekends with us.  Thanksgiving was a small affair
 with just Amanda and me.
 
*Weight:* 220

*New goal:* Write a single program/script for personal use.
